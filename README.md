## PyBlog - BashBlog Python3 Rewrite
### I intend to rewrite bashblog ([github.com/the8woodcutter/bashblog](https://github.com/the8woodcutter/bashblog)) in python to do essentially the same thing.

### Ideas
* people are welcome to submit PR to this to help my slowness or to offer swifter code
* my idea is to copy the functions but streamline it and make it more readable and customizable for people to make custom templates.  I've seen a lot of bashblogs, all with default templates and I've noticed that myself and at least one other have had major difficulty modifying templates for this where it would seem obvious it should work well.  BASH is a difficult language to perform this task but in the nature of the original bash blog I thought to stay within that nature and let it be a single PYTHON3 script to manage the whole site, just that you can modify the template a lot easier and less janky.
* we want this to be more readable code, less janky and remove some of the unnecessary or unwanted social aspects like the twitter functions and possibly the disqus functions.
* possibly add twtxt somewhere

**This is a README.md file.  There is nothing else to add at the moment.**
