## `PyBlog v0.1`

### Python3 weblog site generator script -- Single script to create and manage a blog using only python and text files
#### I intend to redo bashblog ([github.com/the8woodcutter/bashblog](https://github.com/the8woodcutter/bashblog)) in python to do essentially the same thing
* Author: the8woodcutter || [my XMPP](xmpp:chunk@toofast.vip) || [XMPP room](xmpp:the-subnet@chat.toofast.vip?join)
* Licence: DO NOT COPY (_until licence decided_)

***

### `Ideas`
* I've decided to make a **REDO** not a **REWRITE** as if rewriting is more like copying bashblog code methods (1 for 1 even?), and redoing is copying end result
* Additional feature ideas include a profile self object with variables and avatar (optionally gravatar is an option) for personification,
	* Editable CSS blocks for seperation of spacing, colors, text, block objects, etc **OPTIONAL**
	* Templates segmented more, include javascript, metadata, css, header, nav, body, footer, javascript_head and javascript_footer blocks **OPTIONAL**
	* An attempt of simple to read script and simple function structure
	* Simple seperation from default (easy/simpler) stuff and more involved stuff; perhaps a first run function?  _!Python not to install packages!_
	* RSS automagic using lists that reuses data for twtxt.txt, twtxt.txt we want to maybe use yarn.social extensions?  Webhooks!  APIs!  LoL :D
	* Use of python for ANYTHING functional but when used as a script
* More to come

### `TODO:`
* next/first python function will be 'what do we do with .config?'
	* do we parse it ...  like a class and import it/?!?! <<<<<---
	* anytime we need "key: value" it's imported and referable
* the REAL next thing we do is...  decide what page types, ie: main index, tags, categories, profile, post index, rss index, etc
	* make drawing of the blog intended structure 0-100% (_filling things in as we go_)
