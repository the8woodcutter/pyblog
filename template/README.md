### ```Template README.md```

* more to come, I think...
* what does this directory do?

##### This directory is used for modifying the html blocks in the blog pages (_optional_)
##### It gets squished together all the .html files from this directory into the index pages AND it holds the main HTML template (_default or your customized_)

#### ```TODO:```
* erm, how does python render it's dynamic data to these?
* should they be broken up? (_dumb spaced out question_)
* if a python could python how many pythons could a python python?
* i suspect this directory will get modified, party!
* note: page type segmentation
